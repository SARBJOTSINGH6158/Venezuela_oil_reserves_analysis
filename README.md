Venezuela’s Oil Reserves Analysis Dashboard 📊
This data analytics project focusing on the energy sector. Using a dataset covering 23 reservoirs, I designed a comprehensive dashboard to track production capacity and resource distribution in Venezuela.
Key Features: ✅ Real-time Metrics: Tracking the 390.50 Billion total barrels in reserve. ✅ Granular Analysis: Production capacity breakdown by reservoir name and oil grade (Extra Heavy to Light). ✅ Stakeholder Mapping: Visualizing the production sum by major operators.

Data-Driven Questions & Answers

1. Which individual reservoir or field holds the highest proven reserves?
Excluding the aggregate "Orinoco Belt (Total)" entry, the Maracaibo Basin leads the list with 45.0 billion barrels of proven reserves. It is followed by Zuata and Cerro Negro, which both hold 15.0 billion barrels each.

2. Which Basin/Region is the most active in terms of project count?
The Orinoco Belt is the most prominent region in the dataset, containing 9 distinct reservoirs or blocks. The Oriente Basin follows with 5 reservoirs.

3. What is the average production capacity based on oil type?
The data reveals that Light-Medium Crude reservoirs have the highest average production capacity at 300,000 barrels/day, followed closely by Extra Heavy Crude at approximately 274,500 barrels/day. In contrast, Heavy Crude fields have the lowest average capacity at 45,000 barrels/day.

4. What is the operational status of the reservoirs in this dataset?
The majority of the reservoirs are currently Active (11 fields). However, a significant number are still in the Development (5 fields) phase, while 6 fields are categorized as either Mature or Declining, indicating they are past their peak production years.

5. What is the historical range of oil discovery in this region?
The dataset documents nearly a century of exploration. The oldest discovery listed is the Maracaibo Basin (1914), while the most recent major developments include the Carabobo-2 North and Junin blocks, discovered around 2010.

Key Insights & Observations

Dominance of Extra Heavy Crude: The future of the region's oil industry is heavily tied to "Extra Heavy Crude." While these reservoirs (mainly in the Orinoco Belt) hold the largest volume of reserves, they typically require more complex refining and international partnerships (e.g., PDVSA-Rosneft-CNPC).

Infrastructure & Aging Fields: Several high-reserve areas, such as the Lake Maracaibo fields, are marked as "Declining" with notes mentioning "severe infrastructure issues." This suggests that having large reserves does not automatically translate to high production if the infrastructure is not maintained.

Strategic Importance of the Orinoco Belt: The Orinoco Belt is not just a single deposit but a massive complex (55,000 sq km) that serves as the backbone of the country’s energy strategy, represented by numerous "Junin" and "Carabobo" blocks currently under development.

Production vs. Reserves Gap: There is a notable gap between proven reserves and production capacity. For instance, the Maracaibo Basin has massive reserves (45B barrels) but a production capacity of 180,000 bpd, whereas the Junin Block 6 has much smaller reserves (8B barrels) but a significantly higher planned production capacity of 450,000 bpd. This reflects the high-efficiency design of newer development projects compared to older, mature basins.
